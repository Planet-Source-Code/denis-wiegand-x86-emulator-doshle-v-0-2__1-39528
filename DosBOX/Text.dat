´	ºÍ!´LÍ!DosHLE v 0.01 beta release is an Emulator in HLE style.
It does not Emulate the CPU and his structure, only the
machine code are interpreted and "virtual" executed.
Interrupts are "virutal" simulated like Text output e.t.c

Features:
There are not many fetaure`s at time, sorry, only a few instructions.
The Emulator does not realy emulate an R/M byte but with an HLE 
function does it work too :) 

Future Project:
I`m going to write an full Emulator for the 8086, so you can
emulate old games from the 80s. :))
